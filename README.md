# Moriyama.SuperDocTypeCreate

A package to replace the Document Type 'Create' menu in Umbraco V8.4 and above with a 'super' version that provides additional options and explanations to support people who are new to Umbraco and the different flavours of Document Type that can be created. Also this is useful for experienced users of Umbraco who want a quick way to create an Element Type document type.
